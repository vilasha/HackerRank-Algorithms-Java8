/*	Day of the Programmer

	Marie invented a Time Machine and wants to test it by time-traveling to visit Russia on the Day of the Programmer (the day of the year) during a year in the inclusive range from  to .

	From  to , Russia's official calendar was the Julian calendar; since  they used the Gregorian calendar system. The transition from the Julian to Gregorian calendar system occurred in , when the next day after January  was February . This means that in , February  was the  day of the year in Russia.

	In both calendar systems, February is the only month with a variable amount of days; it has  days during a leap year, and days during all other years. In the Julian calendar, leap years are divisible by ; in the Gregorian calendar, leap years are either of the following:

	Divisible by .
	Divisible by  and not divisible by .
	Given a year, , find the date of the  day of that year according to the official Russian calendar during that year. Then print it in the format dd.mm.yyyy, where dd is the two-digit day, mm is the two-digit month, and yyyy is .

	Input Format

	A single integer denoting year .

	Constraints

	Output Format

	Print the full date of Day of the Programmer during year  in the format dd.mm.yyyy, where dd is the two-digit day, mm is the two-digit month, and yyyy is .	*/
