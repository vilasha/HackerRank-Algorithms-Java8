/*	Sequence Equation

	You are given a sequence of  integers, . Each element in the sequence is distinct and satisfies . For each  where , find any integer  such that  and print the value of  on a new line.

	For example, assume you have the sequence . For each value of  between  and  we analyze as follows:

	Input Format

	The first line contains an integer , the number of elements in the sequence. 
	The second line contains  space-separated integers  where .

	Constraints

	, where .
	Each element in the sequence is distinct.
	Output Format

	For each  from  to , print an integer denoting any valid  satisfying the equation  on a new line.	*/
