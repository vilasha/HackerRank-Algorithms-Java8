/*	Find Digits

	An integer  is a divisor of an integer  if the remainder of .

	Given an integer, for each digit that makes up the integer determine whether it is a divisor. Count the number of divisors occurring within the integer.

	Note: Each digit is considered to be unique, so each occurrence of the same digit should be counted (e.g. for ,  is a divisor of  each time it occurs so the answer is ).

	Input Format

	The first line is an integer, , indicating the number of test cases. 
	The  subsequent lines each contain an integer, .

	Output Format

	For every test case, count the number of digits in  that are divisors of . Print each answer on a new line.	*/
