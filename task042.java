/*	Sherlock and Squares

	Watson likes to challenge Sherlock's math ability. He will provide a starting and ending value describing a range of integers. Sherlock must determine the number of square integers within that range, inclusive of the endpoints.

	Note: A square integer is an integer which is the square of an integer, e.g. .

	Input Format

	The first line contains , the number of test cases. 
	Each of the next  lines contains two space-separated integers denoting  and , the starting and ending integers in the ranges.

	Output Format

	For each test case, print the number of square integers in the range on a new line.	*/
