	Given an integer, , find and print the number of letter a's in the first  letters of Lilah's infinite string.

	For example, if the string  and , the substring we consider is , the first  characters of her infinite string. There are  occurrences of a in the substring.

	Input Format

	The first line contains a single string, . 
	The second line contains an integer, .

	Output Format

	Print a single integer denoting the number of letter a's in the first  letters of the infinite string created by repeating  infinitely many times.	*/
